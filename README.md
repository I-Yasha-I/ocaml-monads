# ocaml-monads

Monad transformer module extracted from

https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap

to work with [core v0.10](https://github.com/janestreet/core).

Please see the original module documentation for more information

http://binaryanalysisplatform.github.io/bap/api/v1.3.0/Monads.Std.html


This is not published on opam, and is a temporary workaround until
the upstream supports core v0.10.
In the meanwhile, this module can be installed using

```
opam pin monads https://github.com/tuvistavie/ocaml-monads.git#master
```
